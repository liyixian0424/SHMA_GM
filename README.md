Assessing the structural health condition using geometrical morphological analysis
There are many functions in the file. TO run the algorithm, only several demos should be run.

First, you should open the edgesDemo.m file, and change the figure directory at Line 25. Run the code and get the detected edges.
Then, you can run the enhancement.m file, to detect the straight lines, and calculate the line-to-edge ratio.
